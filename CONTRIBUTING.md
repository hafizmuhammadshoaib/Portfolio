# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Portfolio**. It's people like you that make it such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

# How to submit a Pull Request

### Submitting a PR for an existing issue:

1. Claim / Comment on the issue, making sure no one else is already working on it.
1. Create your own fork of the code
1. Do the changes in your fork
1. Test Portfolio with your changes
1. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   - Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
   - Make sure you haven't changed any lines of code unrelated to the issue.
   - Send a pull request.

### Submitting a PR for a new fix/ feature:

1. Create a new issue, add [FEATURE] to the title if it's something new.
1. Once we have decided it follows the theme of the project, you can begin working on it. (follow the above instructions from step 2)

### Submitting a PR for small or "obvious" fixes:

1. We generally do not encourage such fixes as the project is very small, create a PR directly for such fixes.

> For small changes, please merge multiple commits into a single commit

1. What version of Portfolio are you using?
2. What browser and Operating System are you using?
